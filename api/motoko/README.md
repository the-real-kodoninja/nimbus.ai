# nimbus.ai Motoko Project Documentation

This README provides an overview of the Motoko portion of the nimbus.ai project, including setup instructions and usage examples.

## Overview

The Motoko component of nimbus.ai is designed to leverage the capabilities of the Internet Computer, enabling decentralized and secure applications. This section outlines how to get started with the Motoko codebase and provides guidance on building and deploying your applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Dfinity SDK](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/installation.html): This is required to build and deploy Motoko applications.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Required for managing dependencies and running scripts.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nimbus.ai.git
   cd nimbus.ai/motoko
   ```

2. Install the Dfinity SDK:

   Follow the instructions on the [Dfinity SDK installation page](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/installation.html).

3. Install project dependencies:

   Navigate to the `motoko` directory and run:

   ```
   dfx new
   ```

### Building the Project

To build the Motoko project, run the following command in the `motoko` directory:

```
dfx build
```

This command compiles the Motoko source files and prepares them for deployment.

### Running the Project

To run the project locally, use:

```
dfx start
```

This command starts the local Internet Computer environment.

### Deploying the Project

To deploy your Motoko application, use:

```
dfx deploy
```

This command deploys your application to the Internet Computer.

## Usage

Once deployed, you can interact with your Motoko application through the provided interfaces. Refer to the specific functions and endpoints defined in your `main.mo` and `utils.mo` files for more details on how to use the application.
