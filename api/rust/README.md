# nimbus.ai Rust Project Documentation

## Overview

The Rust portion of the nimbus.ai project is designed to provide high-performance and secure components that contribute to the overall functionality of the application. This documentation outlines the setup instructions, usage examples, and key features of the Rust implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Rust part of the nimbus.ai project, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. You can install Rust by following the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/the-real-kodoninja/nimbus.ai.git
   cd nimbus.ai/rust
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   cargo run
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/main.rs`: The main entry point for the Rust application, containing the core logic.
- `src/lib.rs`: Defines library components that can be used in other Rust files or projects.
- `Cargo.toml`: Configuration file for the Rust project, specifying dependencies and metadata.

## Usage

After building the project, you can run the application using the `cargo run` command. This will execute the logic defined in `src/main.rs`.
